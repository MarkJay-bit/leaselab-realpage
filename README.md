LeaseLabs by Real Page | Vuejs Web Developer Test
=============================

**Please clone or fork the test from this repo**

Please build the provided design using Vuejs & Vuex. A layered Photoshop file and jpg of the design has been provided. Please contact us if any instruction is unclear. Thank you!

**Rules and Requirements**
+ We are interested in simplicity and your command of the front-end development languages and Vuejs rather than other libraries and frameworks. However, you may use any library or framework that will work with Vue to build the website. 
+ We have created an initial Vue project in the project/ directory. Please use this to build out your project. 
+ For the 3 column image section please create a Vuex store and reference the images object in images.js in the root. Each of the images contain an image path, a heading, and description text. Use store to build a 3-column image section at the bottom of the content area on the main page, showing images and their associated hover states.
+ The home & about pages can be identical or you can choose to block one of those routes off. 
+ Please use your judgement to make this page responsive. Simpler versions of elements on mobile is ok.
+ You may use a CSS framework if you like, but extra consideration will be given if you can showcase your command of simple media queries. Bonus points for exampling a "mobile first" approach.
+ Pixel perfection is not expected. We are more interested in conveying the feel of the design.


**What We're Interested In**
+ Command of Languages
+ Best Practices
+ Intentional and Strategic Organization of Code
+ Efficiency and Cleanliness in Code
+ Browser Compatibility
+ Attention to Detail
+ Usability

**Bonus Points**
+ The use of SASS compiled down to CSS
+ Leveraged use of the store outside of just for the images
